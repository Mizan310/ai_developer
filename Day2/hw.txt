Write a python script
determine compound interest of an amount - A = P(1 + r/n)^nt
    -->> The compound interest formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) calculates the accumulated amount A after t years, where P 
    is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of compounding periods per year, and t is time in years.

    -->> Compound interest is defined as a method to calculate interest on an initial amount plus the accumulated 
        interest from previous years, using the formula CI = P[(1 + r)‚Åø - 1], where CI is compound interest, P is the 
        initial amount, r is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of compounding years.

deposited amount, interest rate, year
